# Automated Retail Sales Monthly Report

**Description**

This repository was an individual project analyzing monthly sales data for a clothing retailer. CSV files on customer demographic data, product data, monthly transaction data, and monthly product views data were given. From that, I created a report that calculated and analyzed certain retail sales metrics. This report was also automated so that with new monthly data, a new report can be generated within seconds by simply changing a few lines of code to import the new data.
